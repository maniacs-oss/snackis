### Introduction
Snackis aims to be an effective tool for most secure communication needs using any regular email-account as transport. Peers, encryption-keys, messages and and settings are stored locally, encrypted using a master password. At present; Snackis supports invites/accepts, threaded feeds/posts and projects/tasks.

### Dependencies
Snackis requires a ```C++1z```-capable compiler and standard library to build, and defaults to using [clang](http://releases.llvm.org/download.html#4.0.0) with ```libc++```. This unfortunately means downloading and manually installing [clang](http://releases.llvm.org/download.html#4.0.0) to even run the application, but will improve over time. Snackis further depends on ```libcurl```, ```libpthread```, ```libsodium``` and ```libuuid``` for core functionality, as well as ```GTK+ 3``` for the UI.

```
tar -xzf clang+llvm-4.0.0-x86_64-linux-gnu-ubuntu-16.04.tar.xz
cd clang+llvm-4.0.0-x86_64-linux-gnu-ubuntu-16.04
sudo cp -R * /usr/local/
sudo ldconfig
```

### Getting started
If you're running ```Linux/64```, copy [/dist](https://github.com/andreas-gone-wild/snackis/tree/master/dist) to where you want to keep Snackis; otherwise you'll have to build the executable yourself. Snackis is designed to run completely self-contained and will create everything it needs in the directory where it's started.

### Building
Once a modern enough compiler is in place, execute the following commands to build Snackis:

```
sudo apt-get install cmake libcurl4-openssl-dev libsodium-dev libuuid1 libgtk-3-dev

git clone https://github.com/andreas-gone-wild/snackis.git
mkdir snackis/build
cd snackis/build
cmake ..
make snackis
cp snackis ../dist
cd ..
cp -R dist/ ?
```

### Master Password
Each Snackis installation is protected by a master password that is used to encrypt the database. When started with a fresh database, the first thing Snackis will do is ask for a new password.

### UI
Snackis UI is divided into three parts; to the left is the read-only console, where output is printed; below is the reader, where commands may be given; and to the right is a stack of open views. Despite it's graphical appearance, Snackis is designed from the ground up to be effectively keyboard-driven. Each new view is pushed onto the stack when opened and popped when closed. Many buttons have mnemonics that may be revealed by pressing ```Alt```. Pressing ```Escape``` moves focus between current view and reader, and ```Ctrl-Tab``` switches between open views.

#### Style
The entire UI may be styled by editing ```/gui.css```, running the application with an empty file displays the default GTK-style.

### Setup
Once inside, the first thing you probably want to do is to have a look at the setup. Type ```setup``` and press ```Return``` in the reader to open the setup view. Imap/Smtp are required to do anything beyond local/personal use.

### Invites
Type ```"foo@bar.com" invite``` in the reader and press ```Return``` to create a new invite. Snackis will send an email containing your public encryption-key to the specified address. When an invite is accepted, a reply is sent to inform the inviting peer. The easiest way to see how it works is to send an invite to your own address.

### Peers
Type ```peer-search``` in the reader and press ```Return``` to search Peers locally. Peers are sorted by name. A short-cut is provided to find peers by id; execute ```"#" peer``` to open the specified peer, any unique part of the id will do.

### Messages
All Snackis-messages look more or less the same to the outside world, the actual data is appended in encrypted (except for invites) and encoded form below the ```__SNACKIS__```-marker.

![message example](images/message.png?raw=true)

### Sending
Snackis stores all outgoing messages in an outbox that may be manually emptied at any time by typing ```send``` and pressing ```Return``` in the reader. Automatic sending at regular intervals is supported through ```Smtp Poll``` in ```Setup```.

### Fetching
Type ```fetch``` and press return in the reader to fetch email manually. Automatic fetching at regular intervals is supported through ```Imap Poll``` in ```Setup```.

### Email Security
If you haven't previously used external clients with your email-address, it's quite likely that you'll get an error when Snackis tries connecting to the server. Most email providers will send a message to your inbox with a warning and instructions on how to enable external access. Rest assured that there is nothing insecure about Snackis way of accessing your email; and as long as you don't type in your server-details anywhere else, nothing bad can happen.

### Inbox
Incoming messages arrive in the inbox, type ```inbox``` end press ```Return``` in the reader to open the inbox form.

### Feeds
Snackis main mode of communication is using feeds/posts. Type ```feed-new``` in the reader and press ```Return``` to start a new feed.

#### Searching
Type ```feed-search``` in the reader and press ```Return``` to search feeds. Tasks are sorted descending by time of creation. A short-cut is provided to find feeds by id, execute ```"#" feed``` to open the specified feed, any unique part of the id will do.

![feed search example](images/feed_search.png?raw=true)

### Posts
Type ```post-new``` in the reader and press ```Return``` to post in existing feed. Clicking ```New Post``` creates a new post in the same feed, while ```New Reply``` posts in a separate reply-feed.

![post example](images/post.png?raw=true)

#### Searching
Type ```post-search``` in the reader and press ```Return``` to search posts. Posts are sorted descending by time of creation. A short-cut is provided to find posts by id, execute ```"#" post``` to open the specified post, any unique part of the id will do.

![post search example](images/post_search.png?raw=true)

### Projects
Projects are sets of tasks that may be shared among a set of peers. Each project has its own feed that members may post to. Type ```project-new``` in the reader and press ```Return``` to create a new project.

![project example](images/project.png?raw=true)

#### Searching
Type ```project-search``` in the reader and press ```Return``` to search projects. Projects are sorted by name. A short-cut is provided to find projects by id, execute ```"#" project``` to open the specified project, any unique part of the id will do.

![project search example](images/project_search.png?raw=true)

### Tasks
Each Task belongs to a project and changes are automatically propagated to all project members. Like projects, tasks have their own feeds. Type ```task-new``` in the reader and press ```Return``` to create a new task. A short-cut is provided to find tasks by id, execute ```task id``` to open the specified task, any unique part of the id will do.

![task example](images/task.png?raw=true)

#### Searching
Type ```task-search``` in the reader and press ```Return``` to search tasks. Tasks are sorted by priority and time of creation.  A short-cut is provided to find tasks by id, execute ```"#" task``` to open the specified task, any unique part of the id will do.

![task search example](images/task_search.png?raw=true)

### Todo
Type ```todo``` in the reader and press ```Return``` to show a list of the current top-priority tasks sorted by priority and time of creation. The list includes tasks that are tagged with ```todo```. Finished tasks remain in the list for a specified time period.

### Encryption
Snackis supports encrypting arbitrary data for specific peers. Type ```encrypt``` and press ```Return``` in the reader to open the encryption view. On top of being encrypted; the resulting file is cryptographically signed, and the signature is verified when decrypting. Encoding ensures that the resulting file can be reliable transferred over text-based protocols, it also rougly doubles the size of the output.

### Decryption
Type ```decrypt``` and press ```Return``` in the reader to open the decryption view. Decoding is mandatory for files that were encoded as part of the encryption process.

### Scripts
Snackis includes a custom scripting language called [Snabel](https://github.com/andreas-gone-wild/snackis/blob/master/snabel.md). Type ```script-new``` and press ```Return``` in the reader to open the script view. Snackis reader is also backed by Snabel, which allows convenient evaluation of arbitrary expressions at any time.

![script example](images/script.png?raw=true)

#### Searching
Type ```script-search``` in the reader and press ```Return``` to search tasks. Scripts are sorted by name and time of creation.  A short-cut is provided to find scripts by id, execute ```"#" script``` to open the specified script, any unique part of the id will do.

### Undo
Snackis logs all changes to an undo-stack, type ```undo``` and press ```Return``` in the reader to view and/or manage the stack.

![undo example](images/undo.png?raw=true)

### Locking
Type ```lock``` and press ```Return``` in the reader to lock Snackis and return to the login screen, the application will keep running in the background until closed.

### Algorithms
Snackis delegates anything concerning encryption to [libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium). The IETF-variant of ```ChaCha20-Poly1305``` is used to encrypt the master password and database, while ```XSalsa20```/```X25519``` with ```Poly1305 MAC```-authentication is used for everything else. The master password is hashed using ```Scrypt```, and encrypted using the hash as key for future validation.
